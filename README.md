pebble-t10
==========

My work-in-progress on a 24hr Torgoen T10 inspired face.

Please see comments in T10_SW.c.  I do try to be clear on the choices made.

Credits/Inspiration:
*  ≈Åukasz Zalewsk and the modern watch face, clean design.
*  Some one early on at peeble for creating the initial version.
*  hudson for initial code.
*  Jean-Noel MATTERN for converting hudson's code to the 'current' pebble SDK build process.
